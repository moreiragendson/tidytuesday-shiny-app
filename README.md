# TidyTuesday Shiny App

#TidyTuesday is a weekly data challenge organized by the [Data Science Learning Community](https://dslc.io/) for the R, Python, and Julia developer communities. Every week, a new dataset is posted, and participants are invited to explore the data. Find out more on [GitHub](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday).

My submissions can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/moreiragendson/tidytuesday), and you can use this [Shiny app](https://moreiragendson.shinyapps.io/tidytuesday/) to explore my visualisations and the corresponding code.

This project includes code adapted from:
