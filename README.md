# TidyTuesday Shiny App

#TidyTuesday is a weekly data challenge aimed at the R community. Every week a new dataset is posted alongside a chart or article related to that dataset, and ask participants explore the data. You can access the data and find out more on [GitHub](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday).

My contributions can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/moreiragendson/tidytuesday), and you can use this [Shiny app](https://moreiragendson.shinyapps.io/tidytuesday/) to explore my visualisations with links to code for each individual plot.
